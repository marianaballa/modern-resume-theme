    Since 2016 I am a members of Open Labs Hackerspace. At Open Labs I have been involed with the organisation of several open source related events (from small meet ups to larger conferences). At the Open Labs community I have learnt a lot regarding the open source philosophy, online privacy and the importance of open data and open govermental startegies. All the above, both in theory and in practice. 
    
    Starting from December 2017 I am a board member of the community. Board members are the legal representatices of the community, which legally is a Non Profit Organisation (NGO). As a board member, I have learnt a lot on how organisations are run, how to respect the frame regarding NGO's and how to communicate more effectivelly with people.
