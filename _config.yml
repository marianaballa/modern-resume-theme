  My name is Mariana and I am a Community Manager. I have a BA degree in ICT and a Masters degree based on the same subject, both granted by the Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tirana. For the past three years I have been heavily involed with the use and promotion of the Open Source philosophy. 
  I am fluent in Albanian, Greek and English. I enjoy working with diverse groups of people as I consider them more productive and very beneficial for both the organisation and the individuals.
